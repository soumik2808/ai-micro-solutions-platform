# AI Micro-Solutions Platform 🎥🧠

A free and open-source platform that enables teachers and educators to create, reuse, and share AI-generated short videos aimed at solving specific student or classroom challenges.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Many school challenges — like bullying, absenteeism, poor hygiene, or lack of motivation — can be addressed using emotionally engaging, short videos that offer real-life or imagined micro-solutions. This platform gives teachers access to a growing library of such videos.

---

- Browse existing short videos addressing classroom issues
- Upload your own video with problem tags (e.g., "bullying", "lateness")
- Categorize videos based on common school challenges
- Open-access: no paywalls or login barriers
- Simple, mobile-friendly interface

---

## 💡 Future Scope

- AI-based video generation (D-ID, Synthesia, GPT + voice)
- Community voting and feedback on solutions
- Integration with teacher platforms (e.g., TFI internal)
- Direct classroom-play mode (fullscreen, no distractions)
